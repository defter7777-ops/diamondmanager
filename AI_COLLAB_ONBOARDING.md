## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### **Frontend-Only Strategy** ‚úÖ
DiamondManager is a **React frontend** that connects to existing Diamond Makers backend microservices.

```
DiamondManager Frontend (React) 
    ‚Üì API calls
Existing Backend Services:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-service (team authentication)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-service (profiles + goals) 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-service (team management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feedback-service (peer feedback)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ diamond-coach-service (AI assistant) [TO BE BUILT]
```

### **Database Collections**
```javascript
// Existing (Ready to use)
users_diamondmanager  // Team member authentication ‚úÖ
teams                 // Diamond Makers team structure ‚úÖ  
feedback             // Basic peer feedback ‚úÖ

// New (DiamondManager specific)
diamondmanager_goals        // Personal/team goals
diamondmanager_tasks        // Task management
diamondmanager_achievements // Progress tracking  
diamondmanager_innovations  // Confidential projects

```

## üîê Backend Service Integration

### **Authentication Service** ‚úÖ Ready
```javascript
// Login endpoint for team members
POST https://newapp-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/login
Headers: { 'x-app-id': 'diamondmanager' }
Body: { email: 'tommi@diamondmakers.com', password: 'password' }

// Returns JWT token with DiamondManager app context
Response: {
  token: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  user: { id, email, role, appId: 'diamondmanager' }
}
```

### **User Service** - Extend for Goals
```javascript
// Get user profile
GET https://user-service-production-840d.up.railway.app/api/v1/users/profile
Headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer JWT_TOKEN' }

// EXTEND: Add goals endpoint
POST /api/v1/users/goals
{
  title: "Complete DiamondManager MVP",
  category: "company", 
  visibility: "public",
  targetDate: "2025-10-21",
  description: "Launch working DiamondManager platform"
}
```

### **Team Service** - Ready for Diamond Makers Team
```javascript
// Get Diamond Makers team
GET https://team-service-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/teams
Headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer JWT_TOKEN' }

// Team structure will include all 4 members with proper roles
```

### **Feedback Service** - Extend for AI Coaching
```javascript
// Submit peer feedback
POST https://feedback-service-production-555d.up.railway.app/api/v1/feedback
{
  type: "peer_review",
  targetUser: "mikko@diamondmakers.com",
  content: "Excellent work on the authentication refactor",
  category: "technical_skills",
  aiCoachingSuggestions: true
}
```

## üé® Design System Reference

### **Graphics Reference: DiamondCach**
- Leverage existing Diamond Makers visual identity
- Use DiamondCach design elements and color scheme
- Maintain consistent branding across Diamond Makers ecosystem

### **Component References**
```javascript
// Reuse from existing Diamond Makers projects:
LOGIN_COMPONENTS = "Auth forms, styling, validation from DiamondCach"
NAVIGATION = "Header, sidebar, menu components"  
FORMS = "Goal setting, task creation, feedback forms"
CHARTS = "Achievement reports, progress visualization"
MODALS = "Confirmations, AI coaching dialogs"
```

### **Color Palette & Styling**
- **Primary**: Diamond Makers brand colors
- **Framework**: TailwindCSS for consistency
- **Icons**: Heroicons for modern UI elements
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth interactions

## üö® Common Error Patterns & Solutions

### **Backend Integration Issues**
```bash
# CORRECT: Use curl.exe in WSL2 for API testing
curl.exe -X POST "https://newapp-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-app-id: diamondmanager" \
  -d '{"email":"tommi@diamondmakers.com","password":"test123"}'

# WRONG: Direct curl may fail in WSL2
curl -X POST "https://newapp-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/login"
```

### **Railway Deployment**
```bash
# CORRECT: Use PowerShell wrapper for Railway
powershell.exe -Command "railway status"
powershell.exe -Command "railway up"

# WRONG: Direct railway commands fail in WSL2  
railway status
```

### **CORS Issues**
- All backend services already configured for CORS ‚úÖ
- Frontend domain needs to be added to CORS origins when deploying
- Use proper authentication headers in all API calls

## ‚ö° Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Create and setup DiamondManager project
cd /mnt/c/diamondmanager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server  
npm start

# Test backend integration
curl.exe -X GET "https://newapp-backend-production.up.railway.app/health"

# Deploy to Railway
powershell.exe -Command "railway up"
```

## üß™ Development Testing

### **Test Users (Ready to Use)**
```javascript
TEST_USERS = {
  admin: { email: 'tommi@diamondmakers.com', password: 'asdf1234' },
  manager: { email: 'janne@diamondmakers.com', password: 'TBD' },
  developer1: { email: 'mikko@diamondmakers.com', password: 'TBD' },
  developer2: { email: 'juhani@diamondmakers.com', password: 'TBD' }
}
```

### **Backend Service Health Checks** (All Cloud-Based)
```bash
# IMPORTANT: All backend services are cloud-based on Railway - NO local services
# Verify all 5 production services are operational (documented and tested)
curl.exe https://newapp-backend-production.up.railway.app/health
curl.exe https://user-service-production-840d.up.railway.app/health  
curl.exe https://team-service-production.up.railway.app/health
curl.exe https://challenge-service-production.up.railway.app/health
curl.exe https://feedback-service-production-555d.up.railway.app/health

# Reference existing comprehensive API documentation:
# ../newapp/DOCUMENTATION/API/COMPREHENSIVE_API_DOCUMENTATION_FOR_FRONTEND.md
```
